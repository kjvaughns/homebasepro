# 🚀 Stripe Connect Integration - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

Your Stripe Connect integration is now **fully implemented** with:

- ✅ **Database Schema**: `payment_errors`, `customers`, `invoices`, `payments_ready` column
- ✅ **Edge Functions**: Standardized error handling across all functions
- ✅ **Frontend**: Enhanced error parsing and user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Webhook Handler**: Sets `payments_ready=true` when account fully enabled
- ✅ **Security**: RLS policies on all tables, proper authentication checks

## 🔧 CRITICAL: Add Missing Environment Variable

You **MUST** add this environment variable for the integration to work properly:

### **APP_URL** (Required!)

This is used for Stripe redirect URLs during onboarding.

**Value**: `https://homebaseproapp.com`

**How to add**:
1. Say: "Add a secret called APP_URL"
2. I'll prompt you to enter the value: `https://homebaseproapp.com`
3. Confirm and save

**OR** add it manually in Lovable Cloud settings.

## 🎯 Optional Environment Variables

These have sensible defaults but you can customize:

### **PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT** (Optional - defaults to 5%)
- Controls the platform fee percentage on transactions
- Example value: `5` (for 5%)

### **CURRENCY** (Optional - defaults to 'usd')
- Default currency for all transactions
- Example value: `usd`

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### 1️⃣ **Provider Onboarding** (Start Here!)
```
✅ Go to: Settings > Payments
✅ Click: "Connect Stripe Account"
✅ Complete: Embedded onboarding flow
✅ Verify: Green "Connected" badge appears
✅ Check: payments_ready = true in database
```

**Expected Result**: Provider can now accept payments!

### 2️⃣ **Process a Payment**
```
✅ Homeowner: Book a service
✅ System: Creates payment intent with platform fee
✅ Homeowner: Completes payment via embedded Stripe Elements
✅ Webhook: Confirms payment → booking status = 'confirmed'
✅ Provider: Sees funds in Stripe dashboard
```

**Expected Result**: Payment flows through with correct platform fee!

### 3️⃣ **Error Handling**
```
✅ Provider not setup → "Complete Stripe setup in Settings"
✅ Payment declined → Clear decline reason shown
✅ Network error → "Try again" option displayed
```

**Expected Result**: User-friendly error messages, not blank screens!

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Payment Errors
```sql
SELECT * FROM payment_errors 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Provider Status
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  stripe_account_id,
  payments_ready,
  charges_enabled,
  payouts_enabled
FROM organizations
WHERE stripe_account_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### Check Recent Payments
```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.status,
  b.service_name,
  b.final_price,
  b.payment_intent_id
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;
```

## 🎉 You're Done!

Once you add the **APP_URL** environment variable, your Stripe Connect integration is **production-ready**!

### What Changed:
- ❌ **Before**: 2xx errors with no useful feedback
- ✅ **After**: Clear error messages with action steps

### Next Action:
**Add the APP_URL secret now**, then test provider onboarding!
